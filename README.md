# Instagram-Clone
_Clone of the popular app Instagram_

Project was created with help Expo. Whole app is created only by functional components. I used Firebase Firestore to save posts and users and by Firebase Storage i saved photos of posts and avatars users. The basic structure of the application was created with the help of a [guide on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S9HM6pprZo&list=PLxabZQCAe5fgatwOQny9wKJVs4YD6xkf1&index=2).
